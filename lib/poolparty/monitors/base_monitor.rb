  Monitor class
  
  Monitors are the basis for PoolParty scaling. Your cloud will expand and
  contract against these monitors. You can set your cloud to be monitored by these
  monitors simply by using them in the contract_when and the expand_when macros 
  on your cloud like so:
  
    expand_when "cpu > 1.2", "memory > 0.94"
    contract_when "cpu < 0.4", "memory < 0.3"
  
  You can also add your own monitors simply by creating a directory in the same
  directory as the pool spec (the same directory as the plugin directory exists) and
  placing your monitor file (format: [monitorname]_monitor.rb) there.
  
  Monitors are simply classes of the name of the monitor. They subclass the BaseMonitor
  class from PoolParty. A sample monitor would look similar to:
    
    class SampleMonitor < PoolParty::Monitors::BaseMonitor
      def run
      end
    end
    register_monitor :sample
  
  The monitor class must have an instance level method called run. This method is called when 
  the cloud is checking the monitor. The output of this method should be the output of
  the monitor.
  
  Notice that at the end, you must call register_monitor :monitorname. This will tell your cloud
  that it can monitor it with this monitor.
